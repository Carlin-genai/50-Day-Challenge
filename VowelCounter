Most vowel counters are boring command-line scripts. We wanted to build something that blends education and fun — with visuals, emojis, and instant feedback — perfect for students, learners, or just playful coders.
✨ Key Features
- Colorful UI with emoji-enhanced vowel reports
- Real-time bar charts for visual vowel breakdown
- Fast and interactive — powered by Streamlit
